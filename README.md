## Project Overview
This project focuses on the visualization of astronomical data, specifically the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) Diagram of stars. The primary objective is to create an interactive platform that effectively displays the classification of stars based on their luminosity and temperature.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to visualize the HR Diagram of stars and classify them into distinct categories, providing an engaging way to understand stellar evolution.

## Features
- Interactive visualization of the HR Diagram
- Classification of stars into Brown Dwarfs, Red Dwarfs, White Dwarfs, Main Sequence Stars, Supergiants, and Hypergiants
- Educational insights into the characteristics of each star classification

## Star Classifications
| Classification  | Code |
|------------------|------|
| Brown Dwarf      | 0    |
| Red Dwarf        | 1    |
| White Dwarf      | 2    |
| Main Sequence    | 3    |
| Supergiant       | 4    |
| Hypergiant       | 5    |
